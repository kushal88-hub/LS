        <h3>Video Summary</h3>
        <p>
            Her video reflection focuses on how she felt that the role of teacher and student isnt one way traffic
            rather thier roles can be interchanged at most times. She also provides suggestions like inclusion of non 
            BB school in the immersion program and inviting some of the DGI students and letting them share their insights.
